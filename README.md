I will momentarily take a note to mention that I know this is technically bad practice as one can just create a new repository for each codebase they build, and should, but this was also just supposed to be a starting ground for some ideas that I could later bake into their own programs.

I have started to make more individual repositories with a single goal in mind, as it is better practice, however sometimes crossovers still happen, for the time being I will leave this as it is, because it isn't doing any harm here.
