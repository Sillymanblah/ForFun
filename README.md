I finally cleaned up this repository and feel comfortable makin it public (I had to do a lot of removing of commits from when I used the repository to try to teach some friends in the repo, still not sure why I did it that way).

I will momentarily take a note to mention that I know this is technically bad practice as one can just create a new repository for each codebase they build, and should, but this was also just supposed to be a starting ground for some ideas that I could later bake into their own programs.

I have started to make more individual repositories with a single goal in mind, as it is better practice. However, sometimes crossovers still happen. For the time being, I will leave this as it is, because it isn't doing any harm here.
