## Objectives:

### Knowledge:

*Visual displays:*

I would like learn how to handle the display of code through either a rendering software or through written code. 

*Memory handling:*

I would like to learn how to deal with large amounts of active memory in code efficiently so that larger programs can be run.

*Object interactions:*

I want to learn how to have objects in a program interact with each other, whether it be in 3D space, or simply through information passing.

*Dimensional space:*

I want to learn how to utilize dimensional space in my programming so that I can have objects moving within it.

*Layering:*

Lastly, I would like to have layers to my programs, multilevel class referencing that is still efficient and reader-friendly.

### Experience:

*Object oriented programming:*

I have some experience already with object-oriented programming, but I would like to expand on that knowledge, to a point where I can help others.

*Class file implementation:*

I have a good amount of experience using classes and yet I believe that I have barely scratched the surface, so I would like to increase my familiarity with classes and their usefulness.

*Long-term commitment:*

I have always struggled with maintaining personal projects, and I really and hopeful that this will be the one that can start to swing that around.
